## Description

[Product](http://ec2-18-184-163-37.eu-central-1.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/api) The project is a web application that allows users to register, manage their accounts, and add products. The routes are secured to ensure the privacy and security of user data.

Users have access to view all products, but they can only add or modify their own products. Additionally, an admin role has been implemented, granting special privileges. Admin users have the ability to edit user profiles and modify any product in the system.

This project employs authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authenticated users with the appropriate permissions can access certain routes and perform specific actions. It provides a secure and organized platform for managing user accounts and product information.
